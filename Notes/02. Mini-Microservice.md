# Mini-Microservice Application

#### Few Notes

1. Goal #1 - Get a taste of a microservices architecture
2. Goal #2 - Build as much as possible from scratch

# What Services should we create?
- For now, we will create one separate service for each resourc in our app.

```javascript
     ----> Create a Post
Posts 
     ----> List all Posts
     

     ----> Create a Comment
Comments      
     ----> List all comments
```
